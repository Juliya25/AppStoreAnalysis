In this project I analyze applications of AppStore.

The dataset is taken from the Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps

The following data was used for analysis: rank, free apps, paid apps, heavy apps, genres of apps, popular apps, suppored many languages and others.

The main library used for analysis is Pandas.
