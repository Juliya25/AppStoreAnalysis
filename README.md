# Analysis of AppStore

In this project I analyze applications of AppStore.

The ready dataset is taken from the Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps

The following data was used for analysis: id, track_name, size_bytes, price, user_rating, prime_genre, lang.num.

The main library used for analysis is Pandas.
